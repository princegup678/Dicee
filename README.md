# Dicee

Simple two player dice game with a title that says Roll the Dice and includes Player 1 dice and Player 2 dice. When user clicks on Roll the Dice button, then the dice will get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and the webpage will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.
